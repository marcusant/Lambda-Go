# Lambda-Go
Lambda is an media and paste site written in Golang.

## Pastes
With lambda, users can submit end-to-end encrypted paste data that can be shared with others without having the encryption key or decrypted text ever touch the server. This helps prevent the ability for an attacker to obtain the content of pastes even if they seize the database.

## Uploads
Lambda supports uploads of most major media types, including audio, video, and pictures in various containers.
